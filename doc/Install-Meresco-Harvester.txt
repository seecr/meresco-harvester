Introduction
============

"Meresco Harvester" is the OAI-Harvester from the Meresco Suite 2005-2009. This document describes the installation of Meresco Harvester version 5.2, the requirements from other Open Source products. For more information on Meresco see http://www.meresco.com

As prior knowledge we assume the reader has read or has knowledge of:

* Python language (see http://www.python.org)
* Unix/Linux System Administration

All sources are published and maintained in subversion at SourceForge, see http://meresco.com/svn Sources are also packaged as source tarballs, to make downloading more easy. These tarballs and some of the dependencies are made availabe at http://www.meresco.com/sources


Requirements
============

All code in Meresco is written in Python, which is available on many platforms. Meresco Harvester is however only tested and developed on Linux machines, some of its code base can be Linux specific. Also some of the requirements may not be available for other platforms.

Each of the following sections describe requirements.

Python 2.4/2.5
--------------

*Python is a dynamic object-oriented programming language that can be used for many kinds of software development. It offers strong support for integration with other languages and tools, comes with extensive standard libraries, and can be learned in a few days. Many Python programmers report substantial productivity gains and feel the language encourages the development of higher quality, more maintainable code.* [#]_

.. [#] quote from http://www.python.org

Meresco requires Python version 2.4 or 2.5, it is available on many platforms, for more information and downloads see http://www.python.org

Mod Python
----------

*Mod_python is an Apache module that embeds the Python interpreter within the server. With mod_python you can write web-based applications in Python that will run many times faster than traditional CGI and will have access to advanced features such as ability to retain database connections and other data between hits and access to Apache internals.* [#]_

.. [#] quote from http://www.modpython.org

The web framework Slowfoot (described later) is based on Mod Python. The web control panel of the Meresco Harvester is based on Mod Python.

Amara XML Toolkit 1.2a2
-----------------------

*Amara XML toolkit is an open-source collection of Python tools for XML processing, not just tools that happen to be written in Python, but tools built from the ground up to use Python idioms and take advantage of the many advantages of Python over other programming languages.* [#]_

.. [#] quote from http://wiki.xml3k.org/Amara

Amara is another XML Parser still being used in Meresco. It is highly recommended to use the exact version 1.2a2 for Amara, due to known bugs in other versions. Installation instructions can be found at http://wiki.xml3k.org/Amara. You can also download it from there ftp site: ftp://ftp.4suite.org/pub/Amara/

Requirements on software developed by Seek You Too
--------------------------------------------------

Seek You Too (CQ2) is one of the partners in the Meresco community, and has developed most (if not all) of the Meresco sources. They have also developed some of the requirements for Meresco which is also available as Open Source code (under a GPL 2 license). All this code is publicly available from http://www.cq2.nl/sources

For each of these requirements a short description can be found below.

Installation of these software components is done using default python setuptools. After downloading run ``python setup.py --help`` for further instructions.

Slowfoot 7.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Slowfoot is an integration system for web-based applications.* It's based on Mod Python and depends on Apache 2.2

CQ2Utils Old 5.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*"CQ2 Utils Old" (cq2utilsold) is a package with a wide range of valuable tools.* Its a typical utils project containing modules used in many of our projects. CQ2Utils Old is a branch from the original cq2utils, it's used for supporting the software based on python2.4 like Slowfoot and Meresco Harvester.

Configuration
=============

All configuration is explained in the README file accompanied in the source tarball.
